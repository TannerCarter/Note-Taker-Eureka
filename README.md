# Description

In this project it did require a bit of going back through the module. I built the structure of my project based off the module to help me distinctively identify what I needed to go through from start to finish. Moving forward, it wasn't quite as difficult when really going through all the documentation for: heroku, express, nanoid. The nanoid took me a second to understand a lot more than the others, but it had a lot of the same concept I've seen in other package - how to introduce it into my code and use it to generate an id per note saved. From here it was a breeze. I did however, have to run through heroku documentation as I wanted to change the name to a custom one, vs the generated name. I learned how to delete the heroku app as well as select my new heroku git. This very much reminds me of github in a sense.
